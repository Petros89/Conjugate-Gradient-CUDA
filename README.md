# GPU-enabled Finite Element Analysis Solver Using Matrix-Free Conjugate Gradient Method

## Thermal Conduction Problem in 3D Box (Hexahedral Structured Grid)
= It achieves maximum speed up of ~112 x times and scales up to 550 x 550 x 550 hexahedral elements using double precision arithmetic
- A summary presentation is given at `petros_matrix-free.pptx.pdf`.

## Boosting performance using CUBLAS linear algebra kernels (ddot,daxpy,dnrm2).

## Runs on >= CUDA 10 versions on TITAN V, Quadro RTX, GTX Devices:
- Arch >= sm_70

## Usage
- Compile `make` to generate executable file (see makefile for compilation info).
- Execute `./GPU_CG`. 

## Demonstration
The results on memory and runtime performance are demonstrated below.
